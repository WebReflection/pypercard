# Example Applications

There are currently three example applications which show how to use
PyperCard to create simple GUI driven apps.

* Adafruit Adventure - a slightly modified version of the example that inspired
  this project. The complete "game" is specified via a JSON file with the
  game assets in the same directory as the game script itself.
* Forms - a simple example of all the different form input elements available
  within PyperCard.
* Name - asks the user for their name and prints a nice welcome.
* Temperature - a very simple celsius / farenheit conversion program that uses
  simple callable transitions to implement the program logic.

To run each of these examples ensure PyperCard is installed and type:

```
python adventure.py
```

(Remembering to replace `adventure.py` with the name of the script in
question.)
